This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and the initialNumToRender prop is set too high.  The app may crash or become unresponsive due to excessive memory consumption.  This is because FlatList attempts to render all items specified by initialNumToRender at once, leading to performance issues.  For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  initialNumToRender={1000} // Too high for large datasets
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
/>
```
