The solution involves reducing the `initialNumToRender` prop to a smaller value, or removing it entirely to let FlatList handle rendering efficiently.  Consider using `windowSize` for better performance and memory management.  Also, ensure data is efficiently processed and rendered.  For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  initialNumToRender={20} // Lower value for better performance
  windowSize={10} // Adjust as needed
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

For extremely large datasets, consider using techniques like virtualization or pagination to further improve performance.
